We are Ximbal Ek, the first experimental rocketry team at the Autonomous Metropolitan University (UAM by its acronym in Spanish).

This page is dedicated exclusively to the Electronics subgroup, where we regularly publish our progress, KiCad designs, flight computer codes, etc.

We appreciate you following us on social media:
